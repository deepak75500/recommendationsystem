📊 Recommendation System Project

Recommendation System is a machine learning‑powered project that builds models to generate personalized suggestions based on user behavior and item data. Recommendation systems are widely used in real‑world applications such as e‑commerce product recommendations, movie/music suggestions, and content personalization.

This project demonstrates how to implement and evaluate different types of recommendation algorithms to provide meaningful suggestions for users.

🧠 Project Overview

A recommendation system analyzes patterns in user preferences and item attributes to predict what users are likely to engage with next. This repository includes implementations of core recommendation techniques including:

Collaborative Filtering (user‑based and item‑based)

Content‑Based Filtering

Matrix Factorization

Data preprocessing and evaluation methods

These methods help generate predictions such as:

“Users who liked item A might also like item B.”
